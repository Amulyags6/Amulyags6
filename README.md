👋 Hi, I’m Amulya G S

👀 I’m interested in full stack development, particularly in the MERN stack, and Java projects.

🌱 I’m currently learning MERN stack technologies (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) as well as working on Java projects.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to MERN stack development, Java projects, or any interesting web projects.

⚡ Fun fact: I have a knack for spotting four-leaf clovers in the most unexpected places! It's like a hidden treasure hunt wherever I go.
